Create a to-do list where you can keep you daily tasks and mask them as complete. the to-do list should have following features:

- button to add an item, when you hover over the button, the color of the button should change.

- Each item must have a task description input field and an option to add planned completion date for each item.

- If the task planned completion date is passed, display 'Due day is passed' below the item and the border should be yellow for that item.

- Each to-do item should be associated with a check-box. when the user clicks on the check box the content of the item should strikethrough (make sure you use index in the array for more efficient operation)

Option to delete an item by clicking on the delete button attached with each item.

## Running React on Repl.it

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started

- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the `.replit` file.
