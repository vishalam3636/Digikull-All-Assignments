# react-add-subtract

Create a simple React application and learn how to manage the state and render JSX

You need to provide an input which accept number
Initialise the result to zero.
If the user clicks on add button, the application will add the number provided in the input to the existing value in result and display the added value in result.

If the user clicks on Subtract button, the application will Subtract the number provided in the input to the existing value in result and display the output in result.

For example in the image user entered 80 in the input and existing value in the result was 20 , when user clicked on the add button result value is updated to 100.

## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started

- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the `.replit` file.
